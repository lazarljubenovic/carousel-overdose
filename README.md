# Carousel Overdose

Comparison of different techniques for creating a simple carousel. No run-time dependencies.

## Quick overview

This repo takes a look at different ways to create a carousel. It starts from a simple implementation and incrementally builds upon it, while talking about pros and cons of each.

## Iterations

There are four iterations:

1. [Trivial iteration](./src/1)
2. [Getting rid of boilerplate](./src/2)
3. [Moving run-time to build-time](./src/3)
4. [Getting rid of JavaScript](./src/4)
