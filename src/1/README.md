> All markup by hand, use JavaScript for interaction.

Although JavaScript is used for interaction, markup is still pretty semantic. Control buttons at the bottom are a native form which is listened for changes through JavaScript.

## Pros

- Semantic markup
- No unnecessary overhead for "generating" carousel

## Cons

- Not DRY markup

## Bottom line

We don't leave anything to runtime that we don't have to. It's, however, not ideal for development because of boilerplate markup.
