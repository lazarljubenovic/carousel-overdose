# 3 (Moving to build-time)

> We automate boilerplate creation using an HTML preprocessor. Interaction still uses JavaScript.

## Changes from previous version

Add Pug for preprocessing HTML.

## Pros

- Semantic markup
- DRY markup
- No unnecessary overhead for "generating" carousel

## Cons

- Another build pipe-line

## Bottom line

Everything that can be done build-time should be done build time.
